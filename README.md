Dashboard
The Dashboard is a web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a user interface for managing products, orders, and users in an e-commerce application.

Features
The Dashboard provides the following features:

Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
CRUD operations for products, orders, and users
Pagination and sorting for products and orders
Filtering and searching for products
File upload for product images
Error handling and validation
Unit and integration testing using Jest and Supertest
Getting Started
To get started with the Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/Karimatif33/NodeJsProjects.git
Navigate to the 
Dashboard
 directory: 
cd NodeJsProjects/Dashboard
Install the dependencies: 
npm install
Create a 
.env
 file and set the following environment variables:
PORT
: The port number for the server (default is 
3000
)
MONGODB_URI
: The URI for the MongoDB database
JWT_SECRET
: The secret key for JWT authentication
Start the server: 
npm start
The Dashboard will be available at 
http://localhost:3000
 (or the port number you specified in the 
.env
 file).

Directory Structure
The Dashboard directory is organized as follows:

The main components of the Dashboard are:

controllers/
: Contains the route handlers for the application
models/
: Contains the Mongoose models for the application
public/
: Contains static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images
routes/
: Contains the route definitions for the application
views/
: Contains the HTML templates for the application
.env
: Contains the environment variables for the application
app.js
: The main entry point for the application
Authentication
The Dashboard uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and stored in the browser's local storage. This token is used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

Error Handling
The Dashboard includes error handling and validation for all endpoints. If an error occurs, the application will return an error response with a status code and error message.

Testing
The Dashboard includes unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest. To run the tests, follow these steps:

Navigate to the 
Dashboard
 directory: 
cd NodeJsProjects/Dashboard
Run the tests: 
npm test
The tests will run and output the results in the terminal.

Conclusion
The Dashboard is a web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a user interface for managing products, orders, and users in an e-commerce application, and includes features such as authentication, file upload, and error handling. Developers who are new to building web applications with Node.js or who want to learn more about building user interfaces with it can use this project as a practical guide and reference.
